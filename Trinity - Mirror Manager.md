This is a very basic entity with little to really discuss. In o-
rder to use this entity, just put a func_mirror in your level a-
nd texture every face except the one you want to be the mirror
with a null texture, then fit the texture to the brush face so
it doesn't tile. Otherwise it will just print out an error mess-
age and won't work.

Console Variables:
te_mirrors - Toggle rendering of mirrors.
te_mirror_players - Set to 1, players will appear in mirrors.
