Because the 25th anniversary update broke the Trinity backend and Imgui injection method;
# This project is archived and in hiatus indefinitely.

** DANGER: ** You need a font file to work with this modbase 
https://github.com/edgarbarney/halflife-planckepoch/issues/12

Current Status:
https://www.moddb.com/mods/spirinity/news/status-report-and-a-small-announcement

**Important Note** : This repo contains code for singleplayer only mods. It is NOT advised to use this base or use code from this base for a mulitplayer mod.

So, basically: Spirit 1.8 + Trinity.

Removed Features:
- Fog. 
  - Obviously. Trinity has it's own.
  
- Mirrors and Shiny Surfaces. 
  - Ditto.
  
- Particle System. 
  - Ditto.

- Footstep Sound Entity. 
  - Instead, it uses the new [Material System](https://github.com/edgarbarney/halflife-planckepoch/blob/spirit/spirit-1.8-trinity/Spirinity%20-%20Material%20System.md)
